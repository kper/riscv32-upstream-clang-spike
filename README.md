# Riscv32 gcc toolchain

This folder contains a `Dockerfile` which has the riscv toolchain and spike installed. The idea is that you put the file `main.c` into the `src` folder and it will run spike for you. Finally we run spike on it.

Steps:

* Add `main.c` to `src`
* Run `docker build -f Dockerfile -t riscv32-upstream-gcc-spike`
* Run `sh i_have_c_file_and_I_want_to_compile_and_simulate_with_the_upstream_gcc_toolchain.sh`
